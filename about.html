        COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market, however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases has occurred.

        A wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported4. These include:
Fever or chills, 
Cough, 
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
Fatigue, 
Headache, 
Nasal congestion or runny nose, 
Muscle or body aches, 
Sore throat, 
New loss of smell or taste, 
Nausea or vomiting, 
Diarrhea.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="text">
        It is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, therefore there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. In some cases, people who get COVID-19 can become seriously ill and develop difficulty breathing. These severe complications can lead to death. The risk of severe disease increases steadily as people age.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="text">
        Additionally, those of all ages with underlying medical conditions (including but not limited to heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease) appear to be at higher risk in developing severe COVID-19 compared to those without these conditions. As more data become available, additional risk factors for severe COVID-19 may be identified.
