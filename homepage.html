      <h1>Covid-19</h1>
      <h4>
        Infectious disease experts say most cases of COVID-19 are mild to
        moderate, like the common cold. But it can be more severe in older
        adults and people with chronic health conditions.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="text">
        Most of the early reported cases had contact with a seafood and live
        animal market, suggesting an animal source of the outbreak. However,
        most cases are now likely to be spread from person to person by droplets
        when coughing. Since this virus is very new, health authorities continue
        to carefully watch how this virus spreads.
