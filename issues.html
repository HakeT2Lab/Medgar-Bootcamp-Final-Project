        animals or humans. In humans there are several known coronaviruses that
        cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common
        cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome

        With cities locked down, organizations across the globe had to make this
        obligatory shift towards this realm of working remotely. The quarintine
        has made bussiness go completely remote. Also companies are getting into

        As we know, colaboration is key. Therefore, many AI services where made
        to organize people in those chaotic times. Those services where then
        share to other companies to prevent the spread of covid-19. During the
        outbreak a range of companies made their algorithms publicly For
        example, Artificial intelligence was leveraged in subway stations, train
        stations and other public places where there is a high concentration of
        people and a high degree of mobility. Some places adapted and incluted a
        new temperature measurement technolgy based on computer vision and
        infrared technology. This technology made it possible to take body
        temperature in a contactless, reliable, and efficient manner, with the
        poeple even unaware of it.
